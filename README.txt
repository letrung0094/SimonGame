DESIGN CHOICES:
    Sequence is generated by generating a random number then modulo it by 2.
    If it is 0, then button is blue.
    If it is 1 then button is red
    Append the result to the sequence which is a vector

    The flashing is done using delays (which can be altered to increase speed). T
    he button is flashed indicating the order
    of the sequence and after every flash, there is a delay so that the
    user can see the order of the sequence.

TODO:
    Sound?
    Semi circle buttons
    Improved high score rankings?
